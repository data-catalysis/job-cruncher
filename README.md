# Job Market Analysis

Big data science project to automatically find out what skills would be in a job post.

Features
----------
- Collect job posts from job portals like Indeed.com, Glassdoor.ca
- Analyze job posts by open-source NLP and ML libraries like spaCy, Scikit-learn.
- Visualize results with Redash, an open-source business intelligence system.

This project is built based on the Docker containers, so it is easy to deploy to a distributed production environment for handling large-scale processing.

Structure
----------
- [collectors/](collectors/) - Data collection module is structured based on a typical Scrapy project. In its submodules you will find out several web spiders to scrape job posts, company reviews and job interviews from Indeed and Glassdoor.
- [models/](models/) - Data model module defines job and occupation models. This module serves as basis for other modules and in charge of storing data into Postgres database.
- [analysis/](analysis/) - Data analysis module is responsible for EDA tasks. There is a submodule [notebooks](analysis/notebooks/) contains various Jupyter Notebooks for job and occupation analysis. 
- [ml/](ml/) - Data mining module performs occupation scoring and competency scoring.
- [datasets/](datasets/) - Sample datasets of job posts, company reviews, job interviews and ONET database.
- [results/](results/) - This folder contains some intermediate results in CSV format used by other modules.
- [ui/](ui/) - Data visualization module is responsible for setting up Redash dashboards.
- [app/](app/) - Main app module is responsible for monitoring other modules to work with each other. This module is also in charge of setting up command lines to run tasks.

Examples
----------

**Example 1:** Crawl job posts from Indeed with data scientist as a search keyword. Also crawl maximum 50 posts from Vancouver, BC.

    python manage.py job crawl indeed --search_kw 'data scientist' --location 'Vancouver, BC' --max_items 50

**Example 2:** Crawl job posts from Glassdoor with data engineer as a search keyword. Also crawl maximum 100 posts from Toronto, ON.

    python manage.py job crawl glassdoor --search_kw 'data engineerâ€™ --location Toronto, ON' --max_items 100 --query toronto-data-engineer-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,7_IC2281069_KO8,21.htm

**Example 3:** Analyze job posts to get the top 50 frequent bigrams.

    python manage.py job analyze bigram --n_top 50

**Example 4:** Compute the matching occupations of job posts using top 50 frequent bigrams.

    python manage.py job occupation-score bigram --k 50 --data_table 'job_occupation'
