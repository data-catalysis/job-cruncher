KoBold Metals is using machine learning, and other scientific computing techniques, to explore for the critical materials needed to build electric vehicles and personal electronics. Our data platform, TerraShed™, aggregates and integrates vast collections of scientific data from around the world. We use the data in TerraShed™ to predict the locations of compositional anomalies and to rigorously quantify how new data can decrease the uncertainty of our predictions. These models – our Machine Prospector™ software – incorporate this value-of-information framework to guide our decisions of where to acquire land and what field data to collect, from geochemical sampling to airborne surveys to drilling campaigns.
