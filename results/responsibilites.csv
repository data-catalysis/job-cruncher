Explore the application of ML, especially deep learning, in the RF communication domain. You will do research on solving open problems in the field.
Develop and scale our data-driven systems. You have interest and ability in both data science and engineering, since this is a hands-on role where you own the whole stack - from modelling to production.
You will be involved in a variety of projects: data collection, data analysis, algorithm design, and scaling up the system, working with engineers who specialize in machine learning, wireless, and software.
You will have substantial independence and responsibility from day one.
Required Qualifications
2+ years of industry experience in large-scale ML modelling and engineering, preferably in deep learning.
Expertise in software engineering at scale, along with proficiency in using industry-standard development tools such as Git, and being comfortable using Linux command-line tools.
Proficiency in Python development, and the usage of libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.
Understanding of basic signal processing concepts, such as signal statistics and the Fourier transform.
Ph.D. or M.S. in mathematics, physics, engineering, or another quantitative discipline.
Eligible to work in Canada
Preferred Qualifications
Exposure to database systems and familiarity with SQL.
Proficiency in C (and familiarity with C++), with experience deploying ML models using libraries such as TensorRT.
We will consider candidates with qualifications that may differ from those above, depending on demonstrated capability in delivering successful ML applications.
What We Offer:
Competitive compensation
Comprehensive health, dental, and vision coverage
Opportunities for career advancement
A challenging adventure of working in an emerging industry with cutting-edge technologies
A fulfilling experience of teaming up with a group of top-talented people
