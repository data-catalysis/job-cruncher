I truly believe their management needs new and improved workshops and most importantly a reminder on their code of conduct because it seemed as though I was the only individual following it, and there definitely was retaliation which BMO apparently has a ""zero tolerance"" for.

Cons:
- lower pay than other banks
- there is an attitude at all levels of the bank to ""get lost of you don't like it here""
- external hires are always paid more than existing staff
- EXTREMELY glitchy, poorly designed and antiquated computer systems
- terrible business banking team and products (dead-last among Canadian Banks)
- constant cuts to ""non-productive"" support/service roles with tellers and associate/assistants
- lack of tenured/knowledgeable staff
- constant ""gaming"" by sales staff to inflate their sales numbers (no one is measured by the same standards)
- poor culture that promotes mediocrity and underpays the most talented staff (this is done in a number of ways, primarily bonuses, pay structure and incentive programs)
- fewer and fewer teller hours are available (many branches frequently operate with a single teller and no lunch coverage)
- lots of inefficiencies with internal systems (for example, mortgage assumptions are done on PAPER and MAILED to head office, all RIFF GIC renewals are done via a manual form that gets processed several days later by the back office, mortgage documents are printed and assembled manually by the lender often taking 30+ minutes, the only way to inquire about a transaction is to order the original paper receipt, among other things).
- employees are not valued and are treated like they are expendable (because they are)
- client statements are not consolidated in one place (you may have to go to 3-4 different programs - more...","['Work Values | Working Conditions | Occupations that satisfy this work value offer job security and good working conditions.

This is well and good if you are the franchise player, but if you happen to be the unlucky team that gets one of these leaders who has no prior experience in your area it can be demoralizing and an exercise in frustration.

Our franchise player was clueless about the innerworkings of our group and so what ended up happening is the function took two steps back in its evolution because she invariably wanted to implement process changes that might have seemed reasonable to the casual observer but simply not practical if you really knew your stuff, but of course we had to smile and carry-on. Another drawback of having one of these leaders is they are susceptible to brown-nosing and shiny objects. This took shape in the poorer performers on the team immediately trying to curry favor with her by sucking up, saying and doing exactly what she wanted and presenting shiny objects that in reality added little value. Unfortunately this tactic worked and much to our chagrin these poorer performers began to get increased exposure (I should note that one of them was recently laid-off in their cost-cutting sweep).

It's still a young company so some of the older code contains some hacks that made things work at the time. I doubt many new companies don't struggle with this. They're doing a good job addressing this and the newer code is much cleaner. There is also high expectations with lofty goals for releases. Yet I've never found overtime to be expected and find the work-life balance quite reasonable, just show a desire to succeed and do your best.

- Great leadership - The leaders have been in the business analytics industry for a couple of decades and know exactly what to look for in a groundbreaking and innovative product of the future.

- Warm workplace community - Visier is still a very small company so everyone knows each other's names. Executives know your name and will talk to you on a regular basis. My previous company was a large company and the top 6 rungs of management have no idea who you are nor what you do.

- Trust and empowerment - leadership within Visier is strongly empowering. For example, our Coops are treated like full time employees and will have full access to tasks and technology that regular employees have access to. Also, people get recognized for all achievements and management do a very good job of making sure to give feedback that promotes your growth.

- Explosive growth - Visier is still in the growth stage of their business and is working hard to hit that explosion in growth.

Work starts at 7:00 am and ends at 7:00 pm with four half hour breaks. During my tenure with Rio Tinto Alcan,
I have learned how to work and manage within a large union environment. In addition, being a heavy industry I have learned to watch out for the safety of my co-workers and my own safety.

The management of Rio Tinto Alcan lists safety as top priority followed by productivity on their agenda. The management is also very supportive and are accommodating to its employees.

Teamwork is very important to get various tasks done and therefore, most co-workers are cooperative and work cohesively.

The most difficult part of the job is working near furnaces on extremely hot days with temperatures exceeding 700 degrees Celsius. In contrast, the best part of the job is being trusted and treated with respect. It makes the employees feel responsible and results in better productivity.","['Work Values | Achievement | Occupations that satisfy this work value are results oriented and allow employees to use their strongest abilities, giving them a feeling of accomplishment.
